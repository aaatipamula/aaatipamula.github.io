# Custom Mechanical Keyboards

## An Introduction

My interest in this hobby stared back when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 when a few friends of mine introduced me to the idea of a custom mechanical keyboard. I love to build things with my hands and the idea of a premium keyboard that I could build with my hands piqued my curiosity. The only real barrier to entry for me was the cost of most kits and boards at the time. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily for my wallet, I had just acquired my first job in retail where I made just enough to splurge and buy all the parts for my first custom mechanical keyboard. 

After hours and hours of research I finally settled on a KBDfans low profile 65% keyboard with a brass plate, Milky Gateron Yellows, and some cheap greyscale keycaps. When the parts arrived I excitedly spent the next few days personally hand lubing and filming the switches, checking the PCB, tuning the stabilizers, soldering the switches, and putting it all together. Up until that point I had owned a fairly nice gaming keyboard that had Cherry MX Blues which I had come to enjoy using, but, this keyboard was something completely new to me. I didn't even realize the experience of typing could be so enjoyable. While I did pay a premium to obtain the board I built, it truly felt like a premium board. On top of that, the fact that I had built this keyboard from (almost) the ground up greatly captivated me. It piqued my interest so much that I decided to sit down and finally learn how to properly touch type.

For me this hobby allowed me to combine a few of my passions, my love for putting things together with my hands, and computer hardware. But I think most importantly to me, I am able to put together something that I know I will use and love. I love the idea that I can put together something that suits me perfectly, and I think that idea is what really kept me in this hobby.

Anyways, after building that first keyboard I dove headfirst into the hobby, buying parts and kits with each paycheck I got. Over the years I slowly amassed a collection of parts and knowledge which I've mostly kept to myself, but which I love to talk about when asked. In recent years, however, I've slowed my roll and am much more selective about what I intend to purchase, but my enthusiasm for this hobby is still very much present.
