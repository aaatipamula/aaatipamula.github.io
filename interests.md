# Custom Mechanical Keyboards

## An Introduction

My interest in this hobby stared back when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 when a few friends of mine introduced me to the idea of a custom mechanical keyboard. Up until that poit I had owned a fairly nice gaming keyboard that had Cherry MX Blues which I had come to enjoy using, but the idea of building something custom for myself piqued my curiosity.

The only real barrier to entry for me like most other people was the cost of most kits and boards at the time (which still applies as of 2023). Luckily, or perhaps unluckily for my wallet, I had just acquired my first job in retail where I made just enough to splurge and buy all the parts for my first custom mechanical keyboard. 

After hours and hours of research on forums, on videos and reading through r/MechanicalKeyboards, I finally settled on a configuration which I liked and was fairly reasonable in price. When the parts arrived I excitedly spent the next few days personally hand lubing and filming the switches, checking the PCB, tuning the stabilizers, soldering the switches, and putting it all together.

While building my first board was an enjoyable experience, I didn't really feel the urge to jump back into the hobby. I was pretty happy with what I built and thought I would stick with this for a while. But, not even a few months later, I decided to purchase another board. To this day I'm not exactly sure what got into me but since that second board I haven't looked back.

As for what really kept me interested in custom mechs, it's really a few things. This hobby really allowed to combine a few of my passions, my love for putting things together with my hands, and computer hardware. But I think more than just those two things, custom building mechs allows me to constantly try new things and find something that really fits me. As I spend a lot of time at a computer for personal and professional reasons I would like to enjoy using the tools I interact with, and building custom mechs really allows me to do that.

Anyways, after building that first keyboard I dove headfirst into the hobby, buying parts and kits with each paycheck I got. Over the years I slowly amassed a collection of parts and knowledge which I've mostly kept to myself, but which I love to talk about when asked. In recent years, however, I've slowed my roll and am much more selective about what I intend to purchase, but my enthusiasm for this hobby is still very much present.
