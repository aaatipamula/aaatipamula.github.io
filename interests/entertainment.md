# Music

I listen to a lot of music. That may be a cliche thing to say, but I really feel like I do. I listen to what feels like a hundred genres in 4-5 languages.

My taste changes throught the year. I'll usually pick a theme, genre, artist, etc. and make playlists based around those ideas. I would not consider my taste in music good however, I just listen to whatever sounds good to me. I rarely pay attention to the lyrics and rather focus on the beat or melody. 

If I had to pick a favorite song right now, it would probably be, [Future by fhána ft. towana](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vdw3w47fXIAT7bvMDruky?si=f6b662f3bab44ca2). Fun fact, if you're familiar with the band fhána you might recognize the voice (*towana*) as the lead singer for the band. This song came out at a time where the founding three members of the band, Saito Junichi, Waga Yuxuki (who left in 2022), and Mitsunaga Kevin did not have a set vocalist. The this song's album (*View from New World Line* or just *New World Line*) was fhána and towana's first collaboration (Future being one of three songs released in the album sang by towana). towana then joined the band as the full-time after this album was released, and the rest is history.

# Movies

Similarly to music I am a casual enjoyer of movies, and, similarly to music I watch a lot of them. I usually adapt my expecations or evaluation of a movie based on what who I think the intended audience is for, which means I probably can't give you a good comparison of how good movies like *Despicable Me* and *Dune* are.

As for favorites I have a few in a few different categories. I do like a lot of super hero movies, but picking just one, it would have to be *Iron Man I*. My favorite animated movie to date is probably *Your Name* (cliche choice of film I know). Out of the more indie films, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* stands out as one of my favorites. While I have enjoyed a lot of the high budget/high profile films usually by a big director I enjoyed *Interstellar* the most.

Honorable mentions are *Dune* for the visuals and soundtrack, and *Everything Everwhere All at Once* which was a very very close tie as the indie film favorite.
