# Music

I listen to a lot of music. The fact that I'm saying that is definetly a signifier and you should not trust my taste in music.

My taste changes throught the year. I'll usually pick a theme, genre, artist, etc. and make playlists based around those ideas. I would not consider my taste in music good however, I just listen to whatever sounds good to me. I rarely pay attention to the lyrics and rather focus on the beat or melody. 

If I had to pick a singular favorite song right now, I would tell you that I can't. But picking a favorite song from my favorite generes, my current favorite Japanese-Pop song would probably be, [Future by fhána ft. towana](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vdw3w47fXIAT7bvMDruky?si=f6b662f3bab44ca2). For City Pop its probably [Sparkle by Tatsuro Yamashita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqobRu9aR3M). Finally for K-R&B its actually two songs that are played in order, [Fallin' by Yoon Hyun Sang](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HshcipCZ4rEiNfKckNShW?si=3d71b747378542db) and [Full of You by So Soo Bin](https://open.spotify.com/track/4q5ozxCIyyM3ZhxkFUFEsG?si=a6f1345e2d514d10). Honorable mentions are [Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison](https://open.spotify.com/track/3yrSvpt2l1xhsV9Em88Pul) and [Show Me How by Men I Trust](https://open.spotify.com/track/01TyFEZu6mHbffsVfxgrFn).

> Fun fact, if you're familiar with the band *fhána* you might recognize the voice (*towana*) as the lead singer for the band. This song came out at a time where the founding three members of the band, Saito Junichi, Waga Yuxuki (who left in 2022), and Mitsunaga Kevin did not have a set vocalist. The this song's album (*View from New World Line* or just *New World Line*) was fhána and towana's first collaboration (*Future* being one of three songs released in the album sang by towana). towana then joined the band as the full-time after this album was released, and the rest is history.

# Movies/TV

Similarly to music I am a casual enjoyer of movies and TV, and, similarly to music I watch a lot of them. Most of the stuff I enjoy can vary but I usually look for well produced and put together movies that have a good story.

As for favorites I have a few in a few different categories. I do like a lot of super hero movies, but picking just one, it would have to be *Iron Man I*. My favorite animated movie to date is probably *Cars* (cliche choice of film I know). Out of the more indie films, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* stands out as one of my favorites. While I have enjoyed a lot of the high budget/high profile films usually by a big director I enjoyed *Interstellar* the most.

Honorable mentions are *Dune* for the visuals and soundtrack, and *Everything Everwhere All at Once* which was a very very close tie as the indie film favorite.
