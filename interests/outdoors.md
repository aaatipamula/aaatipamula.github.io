# Hiking/Backpacking

I was not always interested in hiking. In fact, I used to hate going on hikes! But my love of hiking slowly developed thanks to my family who love who hike, and thanks to my involvement in Boy Scouts. 

My real love of hiking developed on a backpacking trip I took with my Boy Scout Troop to *Philmont Scout Ranch* in Cimmaron, New Mexico. Although I waas apprehensive at first as each day progressed I slowly began to find out I actually enjoyed hiking as an activity. Hiking is not super intensive, but its long and endurance based, which is just the type of activity I thrive in.

From there I have been on a few more hiking trips. The most recent one I enjoyed was a trip to *Mt. Quandry* near *Breckenridge, Colorado*. This was my first 14er and I am looking forward to doing a few more!

# Camping

My interest in camping developed as a part of me joining Boy Scouts. It's main appeal to me is the peace and quiet you usually get with it. It's just you and nature. I don't like bringing along a ton of gadgets and things with me. I just like to enjoy the nature around me, make some good camping food, and sit by a warm fire at night. 

Hot take, maybe, but I like winter camping much better than spring/summer/fall. It does require more gear so you don't freeze, but the weather is just part of the challenge and appeal to me.
