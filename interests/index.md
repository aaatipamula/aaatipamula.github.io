I have a lot of personal interests `(!= “programming”)` which include some of the following.

# Computers
  - [Custom Mechanical Keyboards](/interests/computers#custom-kechanical-keyboards)
  - [Compuuter Hardware](/interests/computers#computer-hardware)
- Custom Mechanical Keyboards/Computer Hardware
- Hiking/Biking/Camping/Backpacking (Favorite hike to date is Mt. Quandry in Breckenridge Colorado)
- Cooking (I love making fried rice)
- Motorsport (Favorite car, any 90’s Porche 911)
- Music/Movies (Favorite music genre/movie to date is City Pop/Dune.)
- Anime (Only the good stuff like Mob Psycho or EVA.)
- Reading (Mostly fantasy/sci-fi but occasionally a biography.)
- Art (I’ve done mostly waxed-based color pencil, but I’ve also tried digital.)
- Woodworking (I don’t have the money to persue this yet)
