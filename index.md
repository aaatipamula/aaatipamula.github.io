# About Me

Hi, my name is **Aniketh Aatipmula**.

I'm currently pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** at [The University of Kansas](https://eecs.ku.edu/).

I'm also working at [vCom Solutions](https://vcomsolutions.com/) as a **Software Development Intern**.

## Interests

I have a lot of personal interests **(!= "programming")** which include some of the following:

  - **Custom Mechanical Keyboards/Computer Hardware**
  - **Hiking/Biking/Camping/Backpacking** (Favorite hike to date is Mt. Quandry in Breckenridge Colorado)
  - **Cooking** (I love making fried rice)
  - **Motorsport** (Favorite car, any 90's Porche 911)
  - **Music/Movies** (Favorite music genre/movie to date is City Pop/Dune.)
  - **Anime** (Only the good stuff like Mob Psycho or EVA.)
  - **Reading** (Mostly fantasy/sci-fi but occasionally a biography.)
  - **Art** (I've done mostly waxed-based color pencil, but I've also tried digital.)
  - **Woodworking** (I don't have the money to persue this yet)
