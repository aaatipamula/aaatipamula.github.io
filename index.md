# About Me

I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at The University of Kansas.

I’m also working at vCom Solutions as a Software Development Intern.
Interests

I have a lot of personal interests **(!= “programming”)** which include some of the following:

- Custom Mechanical Keyboards/Computer Hardware
- Hiking/Biking/Camping/Backpacking (Favorite hike to date is Mt. Quandry in Breckenridge Colorado)
- Cooking (I love making fried rice)
- Motorsport (Favorite car, any 90’s Porche 911)
- Music/Movies (Favorite music genre/movie to date is City Pop/Dune.)
- Anime (Only the good stuff like Mob Psycho or EVA.)
- Reading (Mostly fantasy/sci-fi but occasionally a biography.)
- Art (I’ve done mostly waxed-based color pencil, but I’ve also tried digital.)
- Woodworking (I don’t have the money to persue this yet)
